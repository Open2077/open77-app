# Hacking and counterplay

Hacking lets players attack each other the way netrunners attack V: the attacker aims
at a visible player within range and holds a key, an upload bar fills on both screens,
and if nothing interrupts it the hack lands. Six hack kinds share that upload: Short
Circuit (an electrical hit), Overheat (a burn over time), Cyberware Malfunction (the
victim's Open77 abilities stop answering), Cripple Movement (a slow), Reboot Optics (a
blind) and Weapon Glitch (a jammed weapon). Two implants answer them: Self-ICE blocks
one upload, and active purge lets a player clear a status from themselves or an ally.
You define the grades and install them as cyberware; the server owns timing, line of
sight, damage and every status.

Default keys: hold **F8** to upload on the aimed player, **INSERT** to purge yourself,
**DELETE** to purge the aimed ally, **END** to cancel your own upload. Players rebind them
in Pause → Settings → KEY BINDINGS; the defaults live in
`resources/system/open77_hacking/client/config.lua`.

## Minimal example

A resource that defines one Short Circuit deck, one Self-ICE and one purge implant, and
installs them on the player who runs `/hackkit deck`, `/hackkit ice` or `/hackkit purge`.
It needs the `open77_appearance` character adapter and a configured database, like every
[cyberware](cyberware.md) resource. Hacking implants are ordinary implants: the hacking
definition and a cyberware definition with the same ID, version and grade IDs.

`open77.lua`:

```lua
resource "my_hacking"
version "1.0.0"
dependency "open77_hacking >=0.1.0"
server_script "server/main.lua"
permissions {
    "players.hacking.define", "players.hacking.read", "players.hacking.activate",
    "players.cyberware.define", "players.cyberware.read", "players.cyberware.manage"
}
```

`server/main.lua`:

```lua
local inert = { normalDamage = 0, chargedDamage = 0, knockbackMeters = 0, cooldownMs = 100, chargeMs = 100 }
local kit = {
    deck  = { id = "myserver.short_circuit", slot = "operating_system", profile = "cyberdeck" },
    ice   = { id = "myserver.self_ice",      slot = "self_ice",         profile = "self_ice" },
    purge = { id = "myserver.purge",         slot = "purge",            profile = "active_purge" },
}

CreateThread(function()
    assert(Open77.hacking.define({ id = kit.deck.id, version = 1, grades = {
        { id = "training", range = 20, uploadMs = 2000, staminaCost = 20, cooldownMs = 5000,
          damage = 25, statusMs = 750, recoveryMs = 4000, nonlethal = true },
    }}))
    assert(Open77.hacking.defineIce({ id = kit.ice.id, version = 1, grades = {
        { id = "training", charges = 1, rechargeMs = 15000 },
    }}))
    assert(Open77.hacking.definePurge({ id = kit.purge.id, version = 1, grades = {
        { id = "training", staminaCost = 15, cooldownMs = 8000, allowSelf = true, allowAlly = true,
          range = 10, cancelUploads = true, removeStatuses = true },
    }}))
    for _, item in pairs(kit) do
        local grade = { id = "training" }
        for k, v in pairs(inert) do grade[k] = v end
        assert(Open77.cyberware.define({ id = item.id, version = 1, slot = item.slot,
            profile = item.profile, grades = { grade } }))
    end
end)

RegisterCommand("hackkit", function(source, args)
    local player, item = tonumber(source), kit[args[1] or "deck"]
    if not player or player <= 0 or not item then return end
    local record, reason = Open77.cyberware.current(player)
    if not record then print("character not ready: " .. tostring(reason)); return end
    local result, error = Open77.cyberware.install(player, item.id, "training",
        { expectedRevision = record.revision, operationId = assert(Open77.cyberware.newOperationId()) })
    print("hackkit: " .. (result and json.encode(result) or tostring(error)))
end, false)
```

The attacker runs `/hackkit deck`, waits for the installation to complete (see
[transactions](cyberware.md#transactions)), aims at a visible player within 20 m and
holds **F8** until the bar fills. The target sees an `INCOMING SHORT CIRCUIT` bar and a
warning, and can step behind cover, leave range, damage the hacker, or press **INSERT**
if `/hackkit purge` was installed. `/hackkit ice` makes the next upload bounce off
Self-ICE. Your server's combat scope and team rules must allow the attacker to damage
the target, exactly as for any other attack.

## Server API

All calls live under `Open77.hacking` (and `Open77.statuses` for the two status calls).
Failures return `nil, reason`; mutations return `{ok = true, actionId = ...}`.

| Call | Permission | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `define(definition)` | `players.hacking.define` | Hack definition and grades |
| `defineIce(definition)` | `players.hacking.define` | Self-ICE definition and grades |
| `definePurge(definition)` | `players.hacking.define` | Purge definition and grades |
| `state(playerId)` | `players.hacking.read` | Cooldowns, ICE charges, uploads, statuses, and the running gates `cyberwareSuspendedMs`, `frozenMs`, `malfunctionMs`, `malfunctionBlocks`, `crippledMs`, `crippleHeavy`, `blindedMs`, `weaponGlitchedMs` |
| `action(actionId)` | `players.hacking.read` | A running action or its terminal receipt |
| `statuses(playerId)` / `Open77.statuses.list(playerId)` | `players.hacking.read` | Statuses currently on a player |
| `start(actor, target, definition, grade, options)` | `players.hacking.activate` | Start an upload from script |
| `purge(actor, target, definition, grade, options)` | `players.hacking.activate` | Purge from script, through the same rules as the key |
| `cancel(actionId)` | `players.hacking.cancel` | Cancel your own upload |
| `configureProtection(playerId, {safeArea = bool, resistance = number})` | `players.hacking.policy` | Safe-area flag and electrical resistance (0–1) for a player's current body |
| `clearProtection(playerId)` | `players.hacking.policy` | Remove only your protection scope |
| `Open77.statuses.apply(actor, target, definition, grade)` | `players.statuses.apply` | Apply a grade's status directly, subject to the same eligibility |
| `Open77.statuses.remove(actionId)` | `players.statuses.purge` | Remove your status; damage already committed stays |
| `capabilities()` | `players.hacking.read` | The kinds, fields and caps below |

`start` and `purge` require `options = {operationId = "..."}`; reuse the ID when you
retry the same call, a reused ID with different arguments is refused. Definitions belong
to the resource that registered them; stopping it revokes them and cancels its uploads
but leaves installed implants on the record.

## Options

### Hack grade

| Field | Default | Accepted values |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | `"short_circuit"` | `short_circuit`, `overheat`, `malfunction`, `cripple`, `reboot_optics`, `weapon_glitch` |
| `range` | `20` | 1–80 m |
| `uploadMs` | `2000` | 500–15000 |
| `staminaCost` | `20` | 0–300 |
| `cooldownMs` | `5000` | 250–600000 |
| `damage` | `25` | 0–300, the direct electrical hit of every kind |
| `statusMs` | `750` | 0–2000; the Short Circuit disruption. Ignored by the other kinds |
| `recoveryMs` | `4000` | `statusMs + 500` up to 60000; no attacker can hack this victim again inside it |
| `lockHacking` | `false` | Short Circuit also blocks the victim's own hacking for `statusMs` |
| `nonlethal`, `cosmetic` | `false` | Nonlethal never kills; cosmetic commits no damage |
| `friendlyFire`, `allowSafeArea` | `false` | Grade eligibility; the server's combat veto still wins |
| `interruptOnDamage`, `interruptDamage` | `true`, `0` | Whether accepted damage above the threshold (0–300) interrupts the hacker |
| `evidenceFreshMs`, `challengeMs` | `500`, `1000` | 100–750 / 250–2000 ms for the line-of-sight evidence |
| `effects` | `nil` | The outcome block below |
| `burn`, `malfunction`, `cripple`, `optics`, `glitch` | `nil` | One block, matching `kind`; a block on the wrong kind is `invalid_definition` |

### What each kind does

| Kind | On the victim | Server refuses | Block |
|---|---|---|---|
| `short_circuit` | Electrical hit, `statusMs` disruption | Hacking if `lockHacking` | — |
| `overheat` | Direct hit, then a burn ticked by the server | — | `burn = {totalDamage 0–300 (40), durationMs 1000–15000 (5000), tickMs 250–1000 (500)}` |
| `malfunction` | Listed abilities stop answering | Dash, Ground Slam, Gorilla arming, hacking and purge with `cyberware_suspended` | `malfunction = {durationMs 1000–30000 (5000), blocks = subset of dash, ground_slam, gorilla, hacking (all four)}` |
| `cripple` | The victim's client slows itself: speed x0.75, or x0.4 with `heavy`, no dodge or double jump | Dash and Ground Slam with `crippled` | `cripple = {durationMs 1000–30000 (5000), heavy false}` |
| `reboot_optics` | The victim's client applies the native blind: static, scanner off, accuracy x0.01 | Nothing | `optics = {durationMs 1000–15000 (5000)}` |
| `weapon_glitch` | The victim's client jams the held weapon: it cannot fire | Gorilla arming with `weapon_glitched` | `glitch = {durationMs 1000–15000 (5000)}` |

Every block is optional (defaults in brackets). A burn is split evenly over
`durationMs / tickMs` ticks, the first landing one `tickMs` after impact; `totalDamage = 0`
is a burn with no damage. A malfunction that lists `hacking` also denies the victim its
own INSERT; an ally's DELETE still works.

### The `effects` block

Any grade can add outcomes to its connected upload:

```lua
{ id = "stun", range = 20, uploadMs = 2000, staminaCost = 20, cooldownMs = 6000,
  statusMs = 750, recoveryMs = 6000, nonlethal = true,
  effects = {
      damage = 10,              -- replaces `damage`; 0–300
      freezeMs = 2000,          -- hold the victim; 1–10000, at most recoveryMs
      knockdown = true,         -- victim to the floor; needs recoveryMs >= 1500
      disableCyberwareMs = 5000 -- Dash, Ground Slam, Gorilla, hacking and purge refused; 1–30000
  } }
```

`knockdown` and `freezeMs` share one hold: the victim goes to the floor once (about three
seconds); a longer freeze keeps the ability gate running, and the victim's own client
locks the body from the third second to the deadline. `disableCyberwareMs` is bound to
the character, so a reconnect does not clear it; a Malfunction status, by contrast, is
lifted by purge, death, reconnect and a bucket change.

### Self-ICE and purge grades

| Grade | Field | Default | Accepted values |
|---|---|---|---|
| ICE | `charges` | `1` | 1–8 uploads blocked before recharging |
| ICE | `rechargeMs` | `15000` | 1000–600000 |
| Purge | `staminaCost` | `15` | 0–300 |
| Purge | `cooldownMs` | `8000` | 250–600000 |
| Purge | `allowSelf`, `allowAlly` | `true`, `false` | At least one |
| Purge | `range` | `10` | 1–40 m, for ally purge |
| Purge | `cancelUploads`, `removeStatuses` | `true`, `true` | At least one |

Ally purge needs both players on the same positive combat team. A purge charges its cost
only when it finds something to cancel or remove, and never heals damage already dealt.

## Events

`onHackingTransition(encodedJson)` is the ledger of every hack. Decode the argument with
`json.decode`: `actionId`, `owner`, `attacker`, `target`, `attackerIncarnation`,
`targetIncarnation`, `definition`, `grade`, `kind`, `phase`, `reason`, `startedAt`,
`deadline`, `statusEndsAt`, `amount`, `lockHacking`, `from`, `to` and, on a malfunction,
`blocks`. Phases: `challenge`, `upload_started`, `upload_progress`, `blocked`,
`interrupted`, `impact`, `completed`, `status_applied`, `status_tick` (one per burn
tick, `amount` = damage committed), `status_expired`, `status_purged`, `effect_applied`
and `effect_refused`.

```lua
AddEventHandler("onHackingTransition", function(encoded)
    local t = json.decode(encoded)
    if t.phase == "impact" or t.phase == "effect_applied" then
        print(("%s hacked %s: %s %s %s"):format(t.attacker, t.target, t.kind, t.phase, tostring(t.reason)))
    end
end)
```

Do not infer a second hit from `status_applied` or `completed`; only `impact` and
`status_tick` are damage. Callbacks in one tick can arrive out of order, so correlate on
`actionId` rather than on arrival.

## Optional lab

`open77_hacking_lab` (`auto_start false`) ships every kind as a grade of `lab.short_circuit`
plus ICE and purge, and installs them through the cyberware APIs. Grant testers the
`command.hacklab` ACL. With two connected, alive players `1` and `2` in bucket `0`:

```text
/hacklab attacker 1 training hacking-a-01      -- or overheat, malfunction, malfunction_motion,
                                                --    cripple, cripple_heavy, reboot_optics,
                                                --    weapon_glitch, stun, freeze_long, cosmetic
/hacklab protected 2 training hacking-b-ice-01
/hacklab ally 2 training hacking-b-purge-01
/hacklab scope 0 1 2                            -- allow PvP between the two; /hacklab unscope <id>
/hacklab state 2
/hacklab purge 2                                -- self purge from the server; /hacklab purge 2 1 for an ally
/hacklab protection 2 on 0                      -- safe area; "off 0.5" = 50% resistance
/hacklab remove 2 self_ice hacking-b-ice-remove-01
```

The last argument of an install or removal is the operation ID; use a new one for each
new operation. The grades are in `resources/gamemodes/open77_hacking_lab/server/config.lua`.

## Limits

**One status of each kind per victim.** A second Overheat, Malfunction, Cripple, Reboot
Optics or Weapon Glitch inside the first lands its direct hit and `effects` but its
status is refused, not refreshed: `effect_refused` with the running deadline in
`statusEndsAt` (`status_stacked` from `statuses.apply`). Statuses of different kinds
coexist. With `recoveryMs >= durationMs` nobody is even admitted while the status runs.

**Two halves.** The slow, the blind and the jam are applied by the victim's own client;
the ability refusals (`cyberware_suspended`, `crippled`, `weapon_glitched`, `frozen`)
are the server's. A modified client can ignore its own slow, blind or jam, but it cannot
dash, slam or arm Gorilla Arms through the gate. Reboot Optics has no server half at all.

**Line of sight is client evidence.** The server issues short-lived challenges to both
participants and each client traces the same segment against static and dynamic
collision. A missing, stale or failed trace blocks the upload. This is a shared-evidence
model, not a server-side collision query: two colluding modified clients can defeat it.

**The victim is always warned.** Every incoming upload produces a toast, a chat warning
and the native `INCOMING <KIND>` bar. If the victim's notification cannot be delivered the
upload fails closed. Repeated challenges do not repeat the warning.

**Damage is one ledger write.** The direct hit is electrical (`hacking_impact`, no blood,
no native hit reaction); `resistance` and safe areas reduce it. Burn ticks are thermal
and ignore electrical resistance; a tick the combat rules refuse ends the burn. Purge,
death, revive, reconnect, bucket change, the attacker leaving and the provider stopping
all end a status; committed damage stays.

**Cooldowns follow the character.** Hack, purge and recovery timers are bound to the
durable character across reconnects for the life of the server process; they do not
survive a server restart.

**Protection scopes combine.** Safe-area flags union and electrical resistance takes the
maximum across providers, so one resource cannot clear another's protection. Scopes
expire with the body they were set on.

## Advanced: presentation

`open77_hacking` renders every kind with fixed identifiers; replace its
`server/presentation.lua` to change what observers see, and `client/config.lua`
(`HackingInput.feedback = {flash = true, sound = true}`) to switch the victim's flash and
local sound off.

| Kind | Observers and attacker | Victim's own screen | Everyone in range |
|---|---|---|---|
| Short Circuit | Electrocuted effect on `RightHand` and `Chest`, `electric.arc` on `RightHand`, 1.5 s (to status end, max 2 s) | `status_electrocuted`, electric-blue flash | `quickhack_shortcircuit` |
| Overheat | `fire.tiny` and `smoke.steam` on `Chest` for the burn | `hacks_overheat_lvl1`, heat-orange flash | `quickhack_overheat` |
| Malfunction | EMP and electrocuted effects on `Chest`, `sparks.cable` on `RightHand` for the suppression | `hacks_cyberware_malfunction`, violet flash | `quickhack_cyberware_malfunction` |
| Cripple | No body layer; the slow itself | `hacking_glitch_low`, crippled HUD icon, violet-blue flash | `quickhack_locomotion_malfunction` |
| Reboot Optics | `electric.arc` on `Chest` for the blind | `status_blinded`, `hacking_glitch_low`, blinded HUD icon, white-cyan flash | `quickhack_optics_malfunction` |
| Weapon Glitch | Electrocuted effect and `sparks.cable` on `RightHand` for the jam | `hacks_weapon_malfunction`, jammed-weapon HUD icon, amber flash | `quickhack_weapon_malfunction` |

The attacker's bar shows `<KIND> UPLOAD` while holding, then `<KIND> IMPACT`; the victim's
shows `INCOMING <KIND>`. The bar is drawn at 1.5x while it carries a hacking header.
Client resources can observe a streamed target with `Open77.hacking.observe(playerId)`
and drive the bar with `present({actionId, phase, progress, kind})` / `clear()` behind
`player.hacking.project`; the victim-side statuses use `Open77.hacking.nativeStatus`
(`player.hacking.status`) and `Open77.movement.lock` (`player.movement.lock`). None of
these grant hacking authority, and the `open77:hacking:*` network events cannot be sent
by a resource.
